# UniCoin

SaveUNICOINs A Unicorn in a decentralized and distributed web


The main application will be the ever growing unicorn, which neighs messages to the world. Every user may feed the Unicorn with a small fixed amount of UNICOINs to spread a message. The amount of UNICOINs used as fodder will determine how long amessage will be displayed, leaving new messages queued in the blockchain for a certain period. A maximum time interval prevents unjustified blocking effects and ensures a smooth operation of the application. The unicornâ€™s size will grow proportionally to the coins fed to the unicorn. 
The users will witness an ever-inflating Unicorn-bubble.
